    "- There is a duplicated columns has alot of nan values with other names in *media_df* from column with index `[29]` to `[24]` with 2280 null values\n",
    "- Missing values in *media_df* data frame column `id`\n",
    "- There is columns `in_reply_to_user_id` & `in_reply_to_status_id` & `retweeted_status_id` & `retweeted_status_user_id` & `retweeted_status_timestamp` with alot of null values and retweeted no helpful columns at *twitter_archive_enhanced* data frame\n",
    "- There is null values in column `name` in *twitter_archive_enhanced* data frame must be filled\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Uniqueness**:\n",
    "- There is duplicated values in `id` column at *media_df* data frame\n",
    "- There is duplicated values in `jpg_url` column in data frame *image_predictions*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accuracy**:\n",
    "- Duplicated and untidy values in `expanded_urls` column at *twitter_archive_enhanced* data frame\n",
    "- Data type of `timestamp` column in *twitter_archive_enhanced* data frame is object must be datetime data type into datetime data type\n",
    "- There is zero value and values greater than 10 in `rating_denominator` column at *twitter_archive_enhanced* data frame which must be 10 like others\n",
    "- The `rating_numerator` column has values very high due to `rating_denominator` column is greater than 10 at *twitter_archive_enhanced* data frame which must be devided to reach ten and devided numrator with same number to make correct ratio\n",
    "- To more accurate of data must delete retweets in rows has values of retweeted in `text` has value **RT @**  or `retweeted_status_user_id`columns\n",
    "- Id not right in `id_str` column which It has been cleaned to `tweet_id` *media_df* data frame by comparing id appear in the link of `expanded_url` column in the same row\n",
